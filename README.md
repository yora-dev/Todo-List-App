## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for todo functionality

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **local storage**.  
I learned how to:

- Dynamically add, complete, and remove todos
- Persist data in **localStorage** so the todo list stays after a page refresh
- Implement **light and dark mode** using CSS custom properties

### Continued development

**In the future, I’d like to:**

- Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder todos
- Explore filtering and sorting by completion date
- Refactor with a front-end framework like React for better state management
